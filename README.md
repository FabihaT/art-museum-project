# Art Museum Project
This is a Python-based application designed to manage and interact with an art-themed database provided by a MySQL backend. This is designed using a modular structure with separate files for organization and maintainability. The flow was designed with a simple and interactive command-line interface. This system provides two primary user interfaces: an administrative interface and a guest browsing interface.

## Features:
- As a guest, you can browse information from a selection of tables stored in the art database.
- As an admin, you must login with MySQL credentials and select a table to modify. Key admin functions are inserting, updating, and deleting data.  

Run the program from Application.py.
